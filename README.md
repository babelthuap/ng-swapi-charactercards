# SWAPI Character Cards

_by Nicholas Neumann-Chun_

Lists all planets in the SWAPI database with 2 or more residents. Allows user to choose a planet, and then displays character cards for all residents of that planet.

KNOWN BUG: If the planet list does not show up after a few seconds, try toggling "show/hide".
